# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Facebook Prophet

This project forecasts future stock prices using the Facebook Prophet model, a powerful tool for time series forecasting. It retrieves historical stock data via Yahoo Finance, applies Prophet for trend prediction, and displays the results using an interactive Streamlit app.
# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Facebook Prophet

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using the Facebook Prophet model, a robust and flexible library designed for time series prediction. It includes two Python files:

- `main.py`: This is the main Streamlit application that serves as the user interface. Users can input a stock ticker symbol and select a forecast period. The app then visualizes both historical data and future predictions in an interactive format.
  
- `helper.py`: This file contains the core logic of the application. It fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` API, processes it into the required format, and applies the Prophet model to generate forecasts. The results are returned to the Streamlit interface for visualization.

The project demonstrates a practical implementation of time series forecasting in the financial domain. It combines live data extraction, statistical modeling, and web-based interactivity in a simple and effective way. Ideal for learners and enthusiasts interested in finance, data science, and machine learning.


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure required libraries like `streamlit`, `prophet`, `yfinance`, and `pandas` are installed.
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main10.py
ðŸ§¾ Files
main10.py â€“ Streamlit app for user interaction and displaying results.

helper10.py â€“ Handles data fetching and applies the Prophet model.

ðŸ“Œ Note
This project is for learning and demonstration purposes only. Forecasts are based on historical data and should not be used for financial decisions.
